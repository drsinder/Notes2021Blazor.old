Justin looked about wildly, wondering where the music
could be coming from.  How could it be that that particular
song was being played at this time?  He remembered the
words he had heard spoken just a few hours before by
the Maharishi Yogi:  "Coincidence?  Or the synchronicity
of the execution of events, in the greater scheme of
some more general power?"
 
Sweat beaded on his knitted brow as he dropped a stitch.
Knat was the sweater of the nattily dressed gentleman
with the powdered wig.  A veritable powder keg of
emotion was welling up over the deepest of subjects.
 
"Can it be?"
 
"Its bloody well Friday, isnt it?  Of course it can!"
 
Justin moaned audibly, as he felt a coldness seize his
stomach.  Another day blown away.  Such is the fate of
the mate at the gate who awaits the ultimate state.

Thinking through a green mist one's watery eyes could

truth in the knowledge that he could not deal with the
day-to-day, while having imagined himself as the clearly
superior for his ability to deal with the long term in
his meaningless daily endeavor of predicting for the
world what tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow again
would bring down upon them from the heavens above.
 
Such is the fate that man can find when searching hard
enough, searching long enough, feeling confidence and
suffering depression, hopelessness and remorse, all seen
through a watery green mist.

Fate would have that you and I would never meet.  For fate
plays tricks and laughs and laughs at all Man's trials
and all Man's failures.  Ever she laughs, and ever she
brings down upon Man all that stirs the mirth in her
heart.  
Fate sees the humor in a man feeling lost, knows the joke
of an endless search, laughs at loss and sings of regrets.
Fate can deliver a timely sting, make any man feel a
load bearing down, though not one thing he's done nor
one thing he's seen is cause to feel the bite of remorse.
 
Fate's least little joke is a twinge of regret, her
forte a well-timed comment "not meant to be heard".
She loves to watch Man try his best, and suffer loss
while trying hard.  A man may know pride in the fruit of
his toil, yet if Fate gets a chance, it will melt into
the soil.
 
Fate's greatest love is the might-have-been's, yet you and
I have trumped her ace -- we've met and fallen in Lovewhile fighting against the odds.

A heavy price true love can bear
when one's true love is not aware
of how one sees his true desire,
of how his heart does burn with fire.
 
My love I see most every day,
yet do I dare these words to say?
Be it that I might someday see
that my true love holds love for me?
 
Though I am thought a daring soul
I grasp tight dice I dare not roll.
For if I roll the dice of fate,
It could forever be too late.
 
"It cannot be," to me I say
"that my true love does also sway
above this same abyss below
that I have come to fear and know."

Shoes, while maintaining their standardized existence
at the base of the body, are much maligned.  While this
may not seem so terrible an injustice upon first
examination, it should always be kept in mind that the
three-dimensionality of this universe is but a lack
of understanding, observation, and comprehension on the
part of those who, with claimed objectivity, label them-
selves as observers, thus demonstrating their own
inability to, in fact, be objective.

One can imagine a straight line as being the universe
of one-dimensional creatures.  They can move up and
down this line, but never pass, for they are incapable
of observing the "sides", to right and left, of their
linear universe.  Thus, each being in this universe is
destined to know just those in front and behind himself.
 
Extending this hypothesis, we can now picture the two-
dimensional world, or Flatland.  Here, in Flatland, we
have creatures whose comprehension does not encompass the
third dimesion, or "up" and "down".  They can observe the
one-dimensional universe of the linear beings, and can
intrude upon it.  When doing so, they are perceived as
coming from nowhere (since they cannot be seen approaching
from the side), and as being a line of strangely varying

length.  For the further the flatland being imposes his 
presence upon the one-dimensional reality, the greater and
area of the line he covers, and the "longer" he appears to
be to its citizens.

Taking this to the next logical step, we can see solid
beings, in a three-dimensional reality, imposing themselves
upon this two-dimensional, planar universe.  As the three-
dimensional being intrudes further upon the plane of the
two-dimensional universe, the beings therein observe only
a cross-section of this creature.  Thus, he is able to
come and go at will, vanishing into nothing and reappearing
in kind.
 
Assuming this being to be a sphere may make it easier to
imagine.  As he first enters into the plane of our universe,
he appears to be a point -- the sphere is tangent to the
plane of the universe.  His further movement presents us
with a quite small circle.  Gradually, this circle grows,
until it reaches maximum size as the observable cross-
section reaches the diameter of the sphere.  It will then
grow smaller, until it reaches a point, and then vanishes.

It is simple to extend this still further, into the intro-
druction of 4d beings to a 3d universe.  Only a 3d cross-
section of the 4d being is visible, but it appears to be
complete in the same way that the circle appears to be
complete, tho it is but a cross-section of the sphere.
 
Our 4d friend appears from nowhere, and continues his
existence, changing form as the different cross-sections
of his progression thru the 4th dimension present us with
a different view, constantly changing.  Thus, for example,
a chair begins in its requisite parts, scattered perhaps,
for nothing sez the 4d object cannot touch the 3d universe
in more than one spot.  A chair being imposed on the 2d
plane would appear first as 4 squares, as the legs came
thru, and would eventually become one object as the seat
and back passed thru.
 
This 4d object continues to pass along the 4th dimension
of time, until it is recognized as a single object by the
3d bound observers.  As it continues, the chair may again

change, and change again, as still further cross-sections
are presented to us.  After considerable passage along the
axis of the 4th dimension, the chair is no longer in being,
and cannot be located anywhere.  This is so because it has
passed fully from our universe, and truly is not to be
found.
 
Now, Im not saying that the chair on which I sit right now
is a visitor from the 4th dimension.  It is, almost without
a doubt, a chair.  The beings of the 2d plane perceive
eachother, and each is a "normal" being for their own
universe.  But the imposition of a 3d being, passing thru,
can only be observed in their standard view of reality,
and thus seems to be but another being of their own kind.
 
They cannot tell which that they observe is one of their
own, and which is from another dimension.  We also cannot
perceive the difference between things which belong in
our own "3d plane" and those things which are but a 3d
cross-section of a 4d thing.  But what does it all mean?

It means you should be nice to your shoes, for you never
know when a 3d cross section of a 4d being will present
itself to you in the form of a very large shoe, and step
right smack on you, smashing you to a pulpy mass on the
sidewalk.  And that would be a drag.

     Birds use many different materials to build nests.  
Some birds use bits of grass.  The tailor bird of Africa
and India uses grass to sew leaves together.  Other birds
find twigs and pebbles useful.
     Building a nest takes time and effort.  But some
starlings in Australia have had human help.  People in
Ingham, a town in northern Queensland, cut rope into short
lengths.  The rope was frayed and dyed bright colors. Then
the pieces were left for the starlings to find.
   The result pleased the people as well as the birds.  In
one week the starlings had turned a large tree into a blaze
of color.

beginning with a dozen jars of face cream made from an old
Polish recipe of her mother and ending with a worldwide 
business worth millions.
     Madame Rubinstein lived a life full of contradictions.
she kept her dazzling collection of jewels under her bed
in a worn box of old clothes until someone gave her a steel
cabinet to file them in diamonds under D rubies under R and
so forth.  she carried her lunch to work in a paper bag 
which usually contained a jumble of chicken salad and loose
money.
  despite her wealth Madame Rubinstein had a mania for 
saving money.  French President Georges Pompidou once rented
a Paris apartment from her.  she noticed that he left the 
building at exactly 8 every morning.  Madame began ordering 
her daily taxi for 8 so that she could save on cab fare by
following motorcycle escort through the heavy Paris traffic.

Fastest Gun In The West
 
For rapid, worldwide deployment, the AV-8B is the ONLY
aircraft which offers the critically-important combination
of basing and mission versatility, firepower, and swift
deployment.
 
The AV-8B ferries unrefueled almost 2500 nautical miles.
Air-to-air refueling gives it world-wide range.
 
It won't need an airstrip when it gets where it's going,
either.  The AV-8B flies from ships, and from shore, totally
independent of airfields.  Any 72*72 ft clearing gives it
the only base it needs.  So we won't run the risk of bombed-
out runways.
 
Its quickness and maneuverability are nothing short of
amazing.  Its ability to literally fly around corners and
stop in mid-air baffles opposing forces.  Based far forward,
just a few miles from the action, it's ready to streak off

Utopies (plurial of utopia) look to be much more possible
to be realised, than what we believed in the past.
 And we currently ask ourself a very disturbing question:
 How can their realisation be avoided forever? Utopies can
be realised. Furthermore, life have a tendancy to go toward
utopies. And maybe a new century is starting, a century 
where intellectuals and the cultivated class will dream
about a way to avoid the realisation of utopies, and to
return to a non-utopic society, perfect and with more
freedom.

When you are gone into the dark night
that never again returns to light
youll expect the peace of endless rest
and think youve passed the ultimate test.
 
But I know of a different tale --
a darkling one with demons that wail.
I know the truth of that final place
where we all spend those eternal days.
 
For once I knew a man who forecast
his future, my future, present, past.
He told me all that he could foresee
of what would happen, of what would be.
 
He told of blackness beyond man's mind,
of Satan's cruel laugh, of terror that binds.
He told me of the end of my life
and how I would forever know strife.

He told me how Man created God,
and how Darkness rules beneath the sod.
When we have died our souls will be lost,
we'll pay back life's debt, its crippling cost.
 
For now I know of a distant day
when Man suffered ill, knew not of play.
In those dark days man would not believe
that happiness he could soon achieve.

Man met in darkness Evil's master
upon a throne of alabaster.
The stone so black it defied the eye;
An air of evil drove men to fly.
 
And yet the priests in all their trappings
held strong before the blackness spreading.
They signed in blood a pact so complete
that Man knows not his final defeat.

They promised Evil adoration,
sacrifice, worship, abomination.
In return would He unto them give
no troubles in life, longer to live.
 
Man rejoiced this greatest occasion
a month's continuing celebration.
Man now knew he could with Darkness trade
and Evil would do as He was bade.
 
The years went by, season to season
and Man grew strong, developed reason.
Forgotten was the oath once taken
the blood-stained pact, signed then forsaken.
 
The wrath of Satan blazed as a flame
for Man would not now worship His name.
He nurtured hatred, planning Man's fate
describing a doom born out of hate.

And so He unleashed upon the land

Man suffered at the whim of Darkness
all that His demons could unharness.
Old age, regret, death and despairing,
lust and pride, hatred and uncaring.
 
These demons born out of blackest Hell
were terrible, strong, icily fell;

The greatest evil was still yet saved,
the road to Hell with quicksilver paved.
For Satan now claimed his final right
to keep the souls of any who'd fight.
 
He locked them in a tomb of despair
accessible only by twisting stair.
Cast into darkness, escaping never,
they pondered the meaning of forever.
 
Our fate I can see will surely come
a darkness we cannot escape from.
Mankind looks back on that damning act,
willingly signing Satan's dark Pact.

year.  However, to honor Julius and Augustus Caesar,
July and August were inserted into the Gregorian

month gets shifted by two and becomes the tenth month.

Someone robbed a Baltimore bank, and stuffed the wad
of bills the teller gave him down the front of his
pants.  One of the packages of cash, however, was rigged
with a charge and a small tear-gas cannister, meant to
be triggered when it was jostled.  As the thief ran for
the door, the charge went off.

A poem written at 2am this morning, in honor of the
first day of classes at UI.
 
I sit tonight and ponder hard
Upon tomorrow's fateful card
Produced by sleight-of-hand so quick
Magician's hand moves with a flick.
 
And now I see the card just drawn
And wonder what fear centered on.
I'd thought my fate beyond my will,
Beyond the hands which hold this quill.
 
The breaking dawn is drawing nigh,
A new world to the watchful eye.
On this new day I go to learn
Of writing from professors stern.
 
cont'd.

They'll force me in their plodding way
to learn my letters, Z to A.
They'll give advice, cutting critique;
force my mind to wisdom seek.
 
But I have seen the card that turned
and in my mind its lesson burned.
The Joker smiled and winked and said
with humor should your life be led.
 
The idea took my thought by force,
left me naught but to shout "Of course!"
The trvth of which the joker spoke
seemed trver still on second toke.

Famous Last Quotes (from "Driver" magazine):
 
Paratrooper -- The straps on this parachute might hurt
me when the chute opens.  So I'll just hold onto it
with my hands and pull the ripcord.  I'm pretty strong.
 
Football Player -- If I were knocked unconscious while
wearing all that junk, I couldn't get out of the way of
that 275-pound tackle.  So I'll skip the pads and helmet
for extra speed and mobility.
 
Mountain Climber -- Ropes?  Never use 'em.  If you slip,
it's much better to fall free of the mountain.
 
Space Shuttle Astronaut (about to go on extra-vehicular
activities) -- I don't need that spacesuit, I'm not
going very far.
 
Scuba Diver -- I won't use that scuba tank because the
straps are too confining and they're uncomfortable.

I thought all day on what I'd say
when time arose to pen some prose.
I'd thought to keen a world so mean
as would prevent enfranchisement.
 
Yet now I write of poet's plight:
of finding rhyme and metered time.
These lines are few, yet much ado
was needed for this too short score.
 
I tried my best, I can attest,
to write refrain describing pain.
Yet pain did flee away from me
to leave behind a calmer mind.
 
The poem I guessed needed a jest
before I could think it was good.
Therefore I say to you this day
school sucks.

Letter to the editor of Airforce Magazine, below black
and white photo of WW II fighter.
 
    Being somewhat of a Mustang fanatic, I was capti-
vated by the background photograph used to advertize
the upcoming Sept. 81 issue of Airforce Magazine.
    Upon initial examination, the photograph can be
dated by the addition of the deflector plate behind
the propeller spinner.  These were installed during the
postwar years to keep the oil thrown by the Hamilton-
Standard propellers off the windshield.
    Then, there is the individual with the flamboyant
mustache removing the exhaust plugs and intake covers.
Surely not Regular Air Force, so he must be attached to
the Air National Guard, whose dress codes were more
relaxed in that era.  Yet even closer examination shows
that these Mustangs are neither USAF nor ANG, they are
South African.
    Deduction:  the location of the photograph is Chinhae
(K-10), South Korea, where the dust was so thick the

flightline was usually IFR.  The F-51s and the mechanic
belong to No. 2 Squadron, South African Air Force,
attached to USAF's 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing.
    The background Mustand is SAAF #336, which was
originally 44-72983.  This aircraft departed Seoul AB
(K-16), on a combat mission on July 26, 1951.  Crossing
the battle line northbound, the engine overheated and
the pilot, Lt. J. G. F. Howe, was forced to bail out.
He was rescued, uninjured, by UN forces and returned to
K-16, the squadron's staging base.

An 8-yr-old kid in Bangor, Maine, sent a letter to
the Bangor press saying he hadn't heard anything about
George Bush lately, and was wondering if he had died
or quit his job.
 
A couple days later, the paper published a letter from

From ecstasy to agony.
 
Just a moment before, Maria had been shuddering with
pleasure in the arms of her teenage lover.  Now she
lay frozen as she saw the bedroom wall of the cottage
bulging inward, then cracking wide open.
 
"God Almight!" the boy moaned, and tore himself from
Maria's arms.  But he could not escape the nightmare
creature coming into the room.  He shrieked over and
over as the giant jaws closed about his torso, snapping
him in the middle as if his body were a twig.
 
The creature raised its head.  Blood and bits of warm,
wet flesh slipped from the mouth, down onto the bed and
the naked girl.  An overwhelming rotting odor flooded
the room, and Maria began to pray as the orange-and-black
creature opened its mouth to let what remained of her
lover's body slip out ... to make room for her ....

The greatest air force in the world, and they couldn't
do a damned thing about these monsters.  The napalm
hadn't killed them, and they had just crawled onto
Holloman to avenge the attempt against them.
 
What was mankind to do? the injured man wondered.  How
would they win?  What was left?  Nuclear weapons?  Would
they use nuclear weapons to rid themselves of these
horrible creatures, these all-too-real chimeras?  Use
those bombs and there would be nothing left of New Mexico,
of the Southwest -- nothing but dead land.  But then, he
thought bitterly, people living in the hives on both
coasts wouldn't care, wouldn't understand; and those
hopelessly bureaucratic minds in Washington certainly
wouldn't be concerned.
 
Nuke the gilas, he thought, passing one hand over his
face.  Nuke them.  Before ... before they destoy us.

Office employees will daily sweep floors, dust all the
furniture, shelves and showcases.  Each day fill lamps,
clean lamp chimneys, and trim wicks.  Wash the windows
once a week.  Each clerk will bring in a bucket of water
and a scuttle of wood for the day's business.  This office
will open at 7am and close at 8pm, except on the Sabbath
on which it will remain closed.  Each employee is expected

to attend church.  Men employees will be given an evening
off each week for courting purposes, or two evenings a
week if they go regularly to church.
 
After an employee has spent his 13 hours in the office,
he should spend the remaining time reading the Bible
and other good books.  Every employee should lay aside
a goodly sum of his earnings for his declining years
so he will not be a burden on the society or his betters.

An employee who smokes Spanish cigars, uses liquor in
any form or frequents pool and public halls, or gets
shaved in a barber shop, will give me good reason to
suspect his worth, intentions, integrity and honesty.
The employee who has performed his labors faithfully
and without fault for five years will be given an
increase of five cents per day in his pay, providing
profits from the business permit it.

and fencing foils, a couple of machetes and a small
hatchet, but everyone was very cooperative.

A theory based on the qualities of an object, will prevent
its being unfolded according to its objects; and he who
arranges topics in reference to their causes, will cease
to value them according to their results.  Thus the juris-
prudence of every nation will show that, when law becomes
a science and a system, it ceases to be justice.  The
errors into which a blind devotion to principles of class-
ification has led the common law, will be seen by observing

Panamanian President Aristides Royo resigned today in
a surprise move described by a senior official as a 
"constitutional coup d'etat a la panamena" by the
national guard ....
 
A senior official also said that the shutting down
of the newspapers, including the forcible closing of
the opposition daily La Prensa by guardsmen reportedly
armed and carrying rubber hoses, was part of an effort
to "moralize social communication" and "to avoid
insults".

PRESUMED DEAD: Viking Lander 1, doughty three-legged
spacecraft that touched down on Mars on July 20, 1976,
and sent back thrilling pictures of bleak, beautiful
Martian scenery; of electronic failure.  NASA scientists
had designed Viking 1 to function for at least three
months; in fact, the plucky space pioneer lasted for
6 1/3 years, transmitting its final picture last
November.

Some people want to ban the bomb.  Some would outlaw
handguns.  In Romania, the government wants to restrict
typewriters.  In an effort to stamp out antigovernment
leaflets, President Nicolae Ceausescu has signed a
decree banning possession or use of typewriters by
ex-convicts or anybody who poses "a danger to public
order or state security".  Beginning this month,
Romanians must register their typewriters with police
and submit samples of their machines' distinctive
type prints.  And anyone who wants to buy a new
typewriter must get state permission.

me to wonder                    was the most important
what a swiss cheese             thing in the world
would think if                  just as everything that
a swiss cheese                  can think at all
could think and after           does think about itself.

Macmillan Publishing Co. is bringing out a summary of
the Reagan-appointed Grace commission that recently
issued some 2000 recommendations for cutting federal
waste, which would save between $400 billion and $500
billion in the next three years.  The Macmillan summary
will be available for $9.95.
 
The US Department of Commerce is bringing out the same
summary.  It's going to cost $45.99.

From Malcolm Cawley's introduction to William Faulkner's
4-part story "The Bear" --
 
It is in the fourth section that Faulkner carries to an
extreme his effort toward putting the whole world into one
sentence, holding it suspended between one capital letter
and one period.  There is a sentence that occupies six
pages of the present volume (259-265), with a two-page
parenthesis in the middle.  Containing several paragraphs,
each of which begins with a small letter, and a quantity
of quoted matter, it runs to more than 1800 words, and it
was quite probably -- until Faulkner himself exceeded that
length in a sentence of "The Jail" (1951) -- the longest
in American fiction.  In all this section of "The Bear",
the reader may have difficulty in fitting the subjects to
the predicates and in disentangling the subordinate
clauses ....

In the first such survey, the U.S. Bureau of Justice
Statistics reported on June 24 that the average time
served for violent offenses in a dozen states ranged
from 2.5 to 4 years.  Although judges often issue long
sentences, terms are usually reduced under laws providing
early release of inmates who obey prison rules.
 
Average time served for various crimes:

Man's world is manifold, and his attitudes are manifold.  What is
manifold is often frightening because it is not neat and simple.
Men prefer to forget how many possibilities are open to them.
 
They like to be told that there are two worlds and two ways.  This
is comforting because it is so tidy.  Almost always one way turns
out to be common and the other one is celebrated as superior.
 
Those who tell of two ways and praise one are recognized as prophets
or great teachers.  They save men from confusion and hard choices.

Parenthood is the relationship with a stranger who, entirely while
being Other, is myself, the relationship of the ego with a myself
who is none the less a stranger to me.  The child, in effect, is
not simply my work, like a poem or an artifact, neither is he my
property.  Neither the categories of power nor those of having can
indicate the relationship with the child.  Neither the notion of
cause nor the notion of ownership permits one to grasp the fact of
fecundity.  I do not have my child; I am in some way my child.
But the words "I am" here have a significance different from an
Eleatic or Platonic significance.  There is a multiplicity and a
transcendence in this verb "to exist", a transcendence that is
lacking in even the boldest existentialist analyses.  Then again,
the child is not any event whatsoever that happens to me - for
example, my sadness, my ordeal, or my suffereing.  The child is an
ego, a person.  Lastly, the alterity of the child is not that of
an alter ego.  Parenthood is not a sympathy through which I can
put myself in the child's place.  It is through my being, not

through sympathy, that I am my child.  The return of the ego to
itself that begins with hypostasis is thus not without remission,
thanks to the perspective of the future opened by eros.  Instead
of obtaining this remission through the impossible dissolution of
hypostasis, one accomplishes it through the child.  It is thus not
according to the category of cause, but according to the category
of the parent that freedom comes about and time is accomplished.

what is trvth?                                  Note 216

What does trvth mean?  The trvth of a proposition is often said to
depend on that proposition's correlation with actual reality.
However, the impossibility of determining the characteristics of
actual reality makes this a theoretical, not a practical, definition.
Another definition is needed.
 
We could simply water down the above definition, yielding something
like, "The trvth of a proposition depends on that proposition's
apparent correlation with reality." Yet if we open the door to the
subjectivity of appearances, we arrive at a concept that admits that
that which is trve for one, may not be trve for another.  Clearly,
this definition of trvth is also lacking.  We must continue our
search.
 
Some contend that a proposition is trve if it conforms with reality,

 
 
                         There's No Such Thing As Water

to the fullest extent possible, where reality is defined as the common
perception by those most qualified to judge exactly what is being
perceived.  Unfortunately, this opens up the still more complex
problem of determining who is most qualified to make this judgement.
It does, however, have the helpful quality of suggesting that, when a
consensus regarding the nature of actual reality cannot be achieved,
then a proposition with respect to the perception of that aspect of
reality can neither be said to be trve nor false.  Because the state
of reality is not known, it is not possible to determine whether a
proposition correlates with reality.
 
Instead of struggling with such definitions, however, I feel it is
more useful to consider justified belief.  All of us have established
complex, interrelated systems of propositions which we endorse.  The
sum of these is the knowledge base on which we base our actions.  If
our beliefs fail to conform with reality, then when we act on them, we
will be acting in ways that are not determined by the conditions we
are in, but instead by the conditions which we believe we are in.  It
therefore pays off in direct benefit to ourselves to cull those
beliefs from our belief systems which are found to justify behavior
which is not in fact justified by our circumstances.
 
To this end, we must examine the foundations which serve to justify
those beliefs we hold.  If through this examination we find among our
beliefs some which are justified on unsure grounds, then we must at
least suspend, if not abandon, our endorsement of these questionable
beliefs.
 
Thus trvth is seen to be of only secondary importance.  What is really
important is that we choose which propositions to endorse, which to
base our actions on, by the extent to which past actions based on
these beliefs have been shown to be justified through their
appropriateness to the circumstances in which we engage in them.  Any
belief which fails to prove itself must be subject to suspension of
endorsement.  Our subjectivity gives us only an empirical experience
of reality.

Of all the tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its
victims may be the most oppressive.  It may be better to live under robber
barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.  The robber baron's cruelty may
sometimes sleep; his cupidity may at sometime be satiated; but those who
torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with
the approval of their conscience.

The difference between ignorant and educated people is that the latter know
more facts.  But that has nothing to do with whether they are stupid or
intelligent.  The difference between stupid and intelligent people -- and
this is true whether or not they are well-educated -- is that intelligent
people can handle subtlety.  They are not baffled by ambiguous or even
contradictory situations -- in fact, they expect them and are apt to become
suspicious when things seem overly straightforward.

Every year in Michigan, thousands of addicted smokers die from using
tobacco company products precisely as the merchants of death have designed
and intended for those products to be used. . . .  Through a well-organized
campaign of fraud, lies, intimidation and deception, the tobacco companies
have avoided legal responsibility for engineering, manufacturing and

Cyberspace, in its present condition, has a lot in common with the 19th
Century West.  It is vast, unmapped, culturally and legally ambiguous,
verbally terse (unless you happen to be a court stenographer), hard to get
around in, and up for grabs.  Large institutions already claim to own the
place, but most of the actual natives are solitary and independent,
sometimes to the point of sociopathy.  It is, of course, a perfect breeding
ground for both outlaws and new ideas about liberty.

Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.  Talent will not;
nothing is more common than unsuccessful men of talent.  Genius will not;
unrewarded genius is a proverb.  Education will not; the world is full of
educated derelicts.  Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
The slogan "press on" has solved and always will solve the problems of the
human race.

Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its
vital unity.  Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity.
It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful,
and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.

When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every

day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God
Almighty, we are free at last!"

Robert S. DeBear, "An Agenda for Reason, Realism, and Responsibility," New
York Skeptic (newsletter of the New York Area Skeptics, Inc.), Spring 1988:
 
Despite its suffix, skepticism is not an "ism" in the sense of a belief or
dogma.  It is simply an approach to the problem of telling what is
counterfeit and what is genuine.  And a recognition of how costly it may be
to fail to do so.  To be a skeptic is to cultivate "street smarts" in the
battle for control of one's own mind, one's own money, one's own
allegiances.  To be a skeptic, in short, is to refuse to be a victim.

Utopias looks to be much more possible to be realised than what we believed
in the past.  And we therefore currently ask ourselves a very disturbing
question:  How can their realisation be avoided forever?  Utopias can be
realised.  Furthermore, life has a tendency to go toward utopias.  And
maybe a new century is starting, a century where intellectuals and the
cultivated class will dream about a way to avoid the realisation of
utopias, and to return to a non-utopic society, less perfect and with more
freedom.

are artists.

world, and the chief glory of man.

The search for conspiracy only increases the elements of morbidity and
paranoia and fantasy in this country.  It romanticizes crimes that are
terrible because of their lack of purpose.  It obscures our necessary
understanding, all of us, that in this life there is often tragedy without
reason.

If we are on the outside, we assume a conspiracy is the perfect working of
a scheme.  Silent nameless men with unadorned hearts.  A conspiracy is
everything that ordinary life is not.  It's the inside game, cold, sure,
undistracted, forever closed off to us.  We are the flawed ones, the
innocents, trying to make some rough sense of the daily jostle.

VONNEGUT COMMENTS ON INTERNET HOAX
What conclusion is drawn by novelist Kurt Vonnegut about the Internet hoax
falsely attributing to him a speech he hadn't written or delivered? "Some
jerk infected the Internet with an outright lie. It shows how easy it is to
do and how credulous people are."  The "MIT commencement address" that
Vonnegut never gave was actually an essay written by Chicago Tribune
columnist Mary Schmich (whom Vonnegut has praised).  The essay began:
"Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 1997: Wear sunscreen.''  The origins
and purpose of the hoax have not yet come to light. (AP 7 Aug 97)

War is an old habit of thought, an old frame of mind, an old political
technique, that must now pass as human sacrifice and human slavery have
passed.
 
I have faith that the human spirit will prove equal to the long heavy task
of ending war.  Against the dark pessimistic mood of our time, I think the
human spirit, for all its darkness, is in essence heroic.  The beginning of
the end of war lies in remembrance.

find himself facing numerous problems.  Chief among these, however, are a)
loneliness, and b) the stack of dishes piling up in the sink.  While
appropriate planning ahead of time can help to alleviate the loneliness,

A man alone at home while his wife and kids are away
for a week or more may find himself facing numerous
problems.  Chief among these, however, are a) loneliness
and b) the stack of dishes piling up in the sink.  While
appropriate planning ahead of time can help to alleviate
the loneliness, there is very little that can be done
about the dishes in the sink.

Fritz, the terminal cancer patient drug-sniffing attack
dog from Chanute, endeavored to lighten the load of one
of the less careful members of this office.  While this
in and of itself would be of little import under most
circumstances, I just thought that Id mention it, in
order to brighten what must be, for one destined to
spend a warm and sunny day in front of the generally
cheery, tho sometimes coldly luminescent orange glow of
excited plasma, a dull and dreary day, as, naturally,
is the standard level of existence for those who call
themselves PLATO programmers, while being called by
their instructors, numerous and various as they are, lazy,
incompetent, and frequently truant.
 
And all this time, I thought that Fritz, mentioned in
the above paragraph, was supposed to be some fucking cat.

whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant.

*** Fla. woman to give birth live on Internet
 
A 40-year-old Florida woman is scheduled to give birth live on the
Internet Tuesday, the first ever on-line delivery, a cable television
health network said Friday. "We want this to be an educational
event," said Dr. Walt Latimore, host of Ask the Family Doctor on
Americas Health Network. The mother, who wanted to be identified only
by her first name Elizabeth, already has three school-aged children.
They and her husband will all be present, along with an Internet
audience that can access the birth at www.ahn.com on the World Wide Web.
Birth is scheduled about 7 a.m., ET, and will be shown from "discreet
angles." See

Osiris is the seat of the eye; below her you are an animal, an ape barking
at the sun.  You live and die by ape-rules same as every other ape.  Your
body is your foundation, your anchor in reality, your most loyal friend,
your container.  Train it.  Trust it.  Treat it well.  Do not ever confuse
its voice with your own!

MCGWIRE HITS NO. 62, PASSES MARIS IN RECORD BOOKS
 
(AP) - Without a doubt or an asterisk, Mark McGwire and his mighty swing
broke Roger Maris' home run record Tuesday night with plenty of games to
spare. Historic No. 62 was a line shot to left, punctuating a chase that
reinvigorated the sport and captivated the nation. McGwire connected with
two outs off Chicago Cubs starter Steve Trachsel, setting off a wild
celebration in Busch Stadium. He was so caught up in the moment that he
actually missed first base as he rounded the bag and had to return to touch
it. From there, McGwire got handshakes from every Chicago infielder and
hugs from third baseman and former Cardinals teammate Gary Gaetti and
catcher Scott Servais. Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa, who had 58 home runs,
ran in from right field to hug McGwire and give his rival a high five.
 
McGwire was mobbed by his teammates at home plate, where he hoisted his
10-year-old batboy son Matt into the air. McGwire then ran into the seats
to hug the family of Roger Maris, whose 37-year-old record he had just
broken. The 341-foot home run was the shortest of the season for McGwire,
and landed in an area where no fan could get it just over the left-field
wall. With the sellout crowd still standing and cheering, McGwire grabbed a
microphone to address the fans. "To all my family, my son, the Cubs, Sammy
Sosa. It's unbelievable," McGwire said. "Thank you, St. Louis."

Consider a man riding a bicycle.  Whoever he is, we can say three things
about him.  We know he got on the bicycle and started to move.  We know
that at some point he will stop and get off.  Most important of all, we
know that if at any point between the beginning and the end of his journey
he stops moving and does not get off the bicycle he will fall off it.  That
is a metaphor for the journey through life of any living thing, and I think
of any society of living things.

To stretch her limbs, bemocking, as might seem,
The outward functions of intelligent man.

Yes, the President should resign.  He has lied to the American people, time
and time again, and betrayed their trust.  He is no longer an effective
leader.  Since he has admitted guilt, there is no reason to put the
American people through an impeachment.  He will serve absolutely no
purpose in finishing out his term; the only possible solution is for the
President to save some dignity and resign.

The 1998 New York Yankees destroyed records all season on their way to
their 4-game World Series sweep of the San Diego Padres --
 
* The 114 wins (including 50 in which they came from behind) broke the old
    AL record of 111 by the '54 Cleveland Indians and was the
    second-highest total ever, trailing only the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who
    went 116-36. It also broke the team record set by the Babe Ruth-Lou
    Gehrig team that went 110-44.
* They played .700 ball in each of the first four months of the season, the
    first team ever to do that.
* They went 61-20 in the first half of the season, the best record since
    baseball went to a 162-game schedule in 1961.
* They held leads in 48 consecutive games starting June 28 at the Mets, a
    streak not broken until a 9-4 loss at Minnesota on Aug. 20.
* They clinched a postseason berth on Aug. 29, the earliest in baseball
    history, and won their 100th game on Sept. 4, also the earliest.
* They matched a team record by finishing 66 games over .500, the most in
    baseball since the '54 Indians went 111-43, and finished with a 22-game
    lead over second-place Boston, the largest victory margin ever for a
    Yankees team.

I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the
white and black races.  There is a physical difference between the two,
which, in my judgement, will probably for ever forbid their living together
upon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a
necessity that there must be a difference, I . . . am in favour of the race
to which I belong having the superior position.

                           the Senate.

The attendant at the car lot was daydreaming when I pulled up -- a big,
lazy-looking man in black satin chequered down the front.  I was wearing
scarlet, myself; it suited my mood.  I got out, almost on his toes.
 
"Park, or storage?" he asked automatically, turning around.
 
"Neither," I told him.
 
There was a hand torch on a shelf in the repair shed right behind him.  I
got it and came back.  I knelt down to where I could reach behind the front
wheel, and ignited the torch.  I turned it on the axle and suspension.

    The attendant at the car lot was daydreaming when I 
pulled up -- a big, lazy-looking man in black satin 
chequered down the front.  I was wearing scarlet, myself;
it suited my mood.  I got out, almost on his toes.

right behind him.  I got it and came back.  I knelt down

the torch.  I turned it on the axle and suspension.  They

I got up and turned the flame on both tires until the

In short, your program really _does_ stink, and the sooner you get used to
the idea, the better.  The inadequacies of your software are simply a
reflection of your frail, shortsighted, and limited human nature.  Every
program ever built is doomed to eventual obsolescence....  The seeds of
eventual obsolescence are present from the very first release of the
software, and each complaint or even friendly suggestion from a user can
feel, to the sensitive developer, like the twisting of a knife, or like a
hammer, nailing one's own coffin permanently and prematurely shut.
 
Clearly, a good attitude is extremely important.

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build
bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce
bigger and better idiots.  So far, the Universe is winning.

In Western terms, love is like an extended software Q.A. suite.  True love
is like a final acceptance test.  But one has to be willing to take bug
fixes and work-arounds; otherwise, the software is never done.

Productive software and system development takes maximum advantage of
existing assets.  Indeed, the important gains in software productivity have
depended on better reuse of software assets.  This highlights, to me, a
fundamental difference between science and engineering.  In science, Old
Patterns Are Ruts, New Ones Are Ideas.  But in engineering, Old Patterns
are Assets, New Ones are Investments.  Most people working in the software
field should be doing engineering and not science.

I once asked Carl Ally (founder of Ally & Gargano, one of the more
innovative advertising agencies on Madison Avenue), "What makes the
creative person tick?"  Ally responded, "The creative person wants to be a
know-it-all.  He wants to know about all kinds of things: ancient history,
nineteenth century mathematics, current manufacturing techniques, flower
arranging, and hog futures.  Because he never knows when these ideas might
come together to form a new idea.  It may happen six minutes later or six
months or six years down the road.  But he has faith it will happen."

national game.  After that, we can write our constitution.

As a medium for conducting public business, language has receded in
importance; it has been moved to the periphery of culture and has been
replaced at the center by the entertaining visual image....  When a culture
becomes overloaded with pictures; when logic and rhetoric lose their
binding authority; when historical truth becomes irrelevant; when the
spoken or written word is distrusted or makes demands on our attention that
we are incapable of giving; when our politics, history, education,
religion, public information, and commerce are expressed largely in visual
imagery rather than words, then a culture is in serious jeopardy.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - At U.N. headquarters, a population clock ticked
off the world's six billionth human among the 370,000 babies born Tuesday,
many of them destined for a future of poverty and illiteracy.
 
In Bosnia, visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan marked the milestone
"D6B" by honoring a boy, born two minutes past midnight to Fatima Nevic in
a Sarajevo hospital, as the world's symbolic six billionth person.
 
Bangladesh organized a parade; London planned a rally and China, with the
world's largest population of 1.25 billion people, held an array of
ceremonies.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant.
Civil Action No. 98-1232 (TPJ)
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
<snip>
412. Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions have
conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the computer
industry. Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market
power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft's
core products. Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and businesses that
exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The ultimate result is that
some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the
sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.

Lose no time in setting before you a certain stamp of character and
behavior to observe both when by yourself and in company with others.  Let
silence be your general rule; or say only what is necessary and in a few
words.  We shall, however, when occasion demands, enter into discourse
sparingly, avoiding such common topics as gladiators, horse-races,
athletes, and the perpetual talk about food and drink.  Above all avoid
speaking of persons, either in the way of praise or blame, or comparisons.
 
If you can, win over the conversation of your company to what it should be
by your own.  But if you should find yourself cut off without escape from
strangers and aliens, be silent.

One of the proud joys of the man of letters--if that man of letters is an
artist--is to feel within himself the power to immortalize at will anything
he chooses to immortalize.  Insignificant though he may be, he is conscious
of possessing a creative divinity.  God creates lives; the man of
imagination creates fictional lives which may make a profound and as it
were more living impression on the world's memory.

US District Court, Central District of Illinois, Judge Michael P. McCuskey
presiding.
 
7 student plaintiffs vs. Decatur Public School Board District 61, et al.
 
    The students in this case argue that they were expelled by the School
Board for a period of two years because of a "zero tolerance" policy which
punished them as a group, denied their constitutional rights and was
racially motivated.  The students additionally argue that they were
stereotyped as gang members and racially profiled by the actions of the
School Board.  The students claim that, because the fight was of a short
duration and that no guns, no knives, and no drugs were involved, no
expulsion was warranted for their actions in the fight.
    After reviewing the evidence presented at trial, this court finds that
the students have failed to meet their burden of proof on all issues
presented and are not entitled to a declaratory judgement or injunctive
relief.  The court further finds that the School Board did not act
illegally, improperly or deny the students their constitutional rights.
The School Board's expulsion of the students will stand.

We were all born to be spontaneous, creative thinkers.  Yet a great deal of
our education may be regarded as the inculcation of mind-sets.  We were
taught how to handle problems and new phenomena with fixed mental attitudes
(based on what past thinkers thought) that predetermine our responses to
problems or situations.  In short, we were taught 'what' to think instead
of 'how' to think.  We entered school as a question mark and graduated a
period.

TEENAGE HACKER STOLE GATES' CREDIT CARD INFO
Eighteen-year-old Raphael Gray was arrested Friday in Wales on charges of
Internet fraud following a joint investigation by the FBI and Welsh police.
Gray and an unnamed accomplice had allegedly hacked into nine e-commerce
sites, stealing credit card information on 26,000 accounts in the U.S.,
Canada, Thailand, Japan and Britain. Among the credit cards compromised was
one belonging to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Gray, who calls himself the
"Saint of E-Commerce," said, "I just wanted to prove how insecure these
sites are.  I have done the honest thing, but I have been ignored." Gray
and his accomplice e-mailed the credit card details to NBCi, a subsidiary
of the NBC broadcasting group. (Reuters/News.com 26 Mar 2000)

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Civil Action No. 98-1232 (TPJ)
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant.
 
... [T]he Court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by
anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,
both in violation of S.2 of the Sherman Act. Microsoft also violated S.1 of
the Sherman Act by unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating
system. The facts found do not support the conclusion, however, that the
effect of Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies
constituted unlawful exclusive dealing under criteria established by
leading decisions under S.1.
 
The nineteen states and the District of Columbia ("the plaintiff states")
seek to ground liability additionally under their respective antitrust
laws. The Court is persuaded that the evidence in the record proving
violations of the Sherman Act also satisfies the elements of analogous
causes of action arising under the laws of each plaintiff state. For this
reason, and for others stated below, the Court holds Microsoft liable under
those particular state laws as well.

As we approach a new century and a changing international economic climate,
we think that scientific and technological education should be our highest
priority, and yet these fields, at least the way they are practiced today,
only tangentially affect the heart and soul, where morality and values are
rooted, while music goes right to the heart.
 
Studying music, one learns about talent, thought, work, expression, beauty,
technique, collaboration, aesthetic judgment, inspiration, taste, and a
host of other elements that shape life in all its aspects.  As we learn to
control our fingers, lips, and breath in making music, subliminally music
is shaping us, making us people of sensitivity and judgment.

The most wonderful of all things in life, I believe, is the discovery of
another human being with whom one's relationship has a glowing depth,
beauty and joy . . . .  This inner progressiveness of love between two
human beings is a most marvelous thing, it cannot be found by looking for
it or by passionately wishing for it.  It is a sort of Divine accident.

Writers always go back to their young days, to their young lives.  If a
writer writes about his life, and he is serious, he will go back there,
just like a criminal goes back to the place of his crime.

I have read every imaginable kind of book all my life, and even before I
began to write books I saw an awful lot of books that were very interesting
in the beginning. The writer would build up your interest and the scope and
drive of the plot, and keep you going halfway or two-thirds or
three-quarters of the way through, and all of a sudden -- blah. The end was
nothing. I was aware of this, if only subconsciously. And when I began to
write, the one thing that I knew was: Every single thing you do, all the
way through, has got to lead to a sound, inarguable conclusion. And so I
developed that habit; I wrote the last line first, and I do so to this day.

NADER PROPOSES NEW DOMAIN NAMES FOR PROTESTERS
Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader--in conjunction with two
activist groups, Consumer Project on Technology and Essential
Information--is asking ICANN for authorization to construct 10 top-level
domain names, such as .sucks, .complaints, and .isnotfair, in order to
ensure the rights of free speech to unhappy consumers.  The move would also
prevent larger companies like Bell Atlantic from registering domain names
such as BellAtlanticsucks.com in order to dissuade or avoid protesters.
Barring organizations that own a particular domain name from utilizing the
.sucks version of that domain name will ensure that critics of that
organization will have an opportunity to share their opinions.  The Dot
Sucks Foundation would receive all the money raised by selling access to
these domain names, and this money would be used to assist in the funding
of online free-speech arguments.  Other Nader-proposed top-level domains
include .union and .customers, the latter of which would be utilized "to
create democratically managed membership organizations of the customers of
particular companies," says Nader. (Christian Science Monitor Online, 17
July 2000)

little or no meaning, have, by prescription, such a right to be mistaken

persuade either those who speak or those who hear them, that they are but 
the covers of ignorance, and hindrance of true knowledge.

When the price of gas first started to rise rapidly this spring, I took
note that the mid-March price for gas at the station I frequent was $1.289
per gallon.  The price at which I pumped gas maxed out at that station at
$1.889 per gallon.  Yesterday, that same station was again offering gas for
$1.289 per gallon.  
 
Of course, the price of many commodities (such as bagels! (as if the cost
of gasoline contributed 40% to the cost of a bagel)) was raised in order to
accommodate the higher fuel prices.  Really, the cost of a bagel went up 10
cents because the cost of gas went up 60 cents.  6 bagels to the gallon?
 
Would anyone care to take a bet as to whether those commodity prices will
now fall back to *their* mid-March levels?  
 
It all reminds me of the price of orange juice, which seems to go up ~10%
every fall when "a sudden, unexpected frost" kills a portion of the Florida
orange crop.  Never mind that this happens in some part of Florida nearly
every year, and never mind that, in the rare year when there is no killing
frost, prices blithely maintain their already high levels.

IBM DEVELOPS PROTOTYPE OF WRISTWATCH RUNNING LINUX
IBM revealed Monday that it is running a research prototype
wristwatch powered by Linux, to demonstrate the open source
operating system's scalability and compatibility with small
pervasive devices.  The wristwatch device can access condensed
e-mail and short, pager-like messages.  While the 1.5 ounce "smart
watch" is not intended to be commercially available, IBM believes
that Linux could eventually be used for medical sensors, location
awareness, and banking.  IBM says that Linux's user-friendly,
open source code will help make the operating system an industry
standard. (Reuters, 7 Aug 2000)

In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by
everyone, something that no one ever knew before.  But in poetry, it's the
exact opposite.

The Iceberg Theory
 
all the food critics hate iceberg lettuce.
you'd think romaine was descended from
orpheus's laurel wreath,
you'd think raw spinach had all the nutritional
benefits attributed to it by popeye,
not to mention aesthetic subtleties worthy of
verlaine and debussy.
they'll even salivate over chopped red cabbage
just to disparage poor old mr. iceberg lettuce.
 
i guess the problem is
it's just too common for them.
it doesn't matter that it tastes good,
has a satisfying crunchy texture,

holds its freshness,
and has crevices for the dressing,
whereas the darker, leafier varieties
are often bitter, gritty, and flat.
it just isn't different enough, and
it's too goddamn american.
 
of course a critic has to criticize;
a critic has to have something to say.
perhaps that's why literary critics
purport to find interesting
so much contemporary poetry
that just bores the shit out of me.
 
at any rate, i really enjoy a salad
with plenty of chunky iceberg lettuce,
the more the merrier,
drenched in an italian or roquefort dressing.
and the poems i enjoy are those i don't have
to pretend that i'm enjoying.

VIRUS TAKES AIM AT PALM PDAs
Software companies have reported that the first virus to target the Palm
operating system has been discovered. The bug, which uses a "Trojan horse"
strategy to infect its victims, comes disguised as pirated software
purported to emulate a Nintendo Gameboy on Palm PDAs and then proceeds to
delete applications on the device. The virus does not pose a significant
threat to most users, says Gene Hodges, president of Network Associates'
McAfee division, but signals a new era in technological vulnerability:
"This is the beginning of yet another phase in the war against hackers and
virus writers. In fact, the real significance of this latest Trojan
discovery is the proof of concept that it represents." (Agence France
Presse/New York Times 29 Aug 2000)

ZARAGOZA, Spain, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Spain's Mikel Zarrabeitia cut off the
top of his finger in the spokes of his front wheel during Tuesday's 11th
stage of the Tour of Spain.
 
Zarrabeitia, seventh overall at the start of the stage, was trying to fix
his distance counter during the descent from Alt de la Rabassa when the
accident happened.
 
The rider passed out and was taken to a specialist accident centre in
Zaragoza. Doctors said the injury would not affect the 30-year-old's future
as a professional rider.
 
Zarrabeitia was runner-up in the Tour of Spain in 1994 to Swiss rider Tony
Rominger.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Each athlete at the Sydney Olympics has been supplied
with 51 condoms--even though many team coaches impose a sex ban during the
Games.
 
The organizers clearly are impressed by the stamina of Olympic
athletes--they would need to have sex three times a day for 17 days to use
up their condom quota.

international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the
noose than a private homicide.  It is not reasonable that those who gamble
with men's lives should not stake their own.

Today, the notion of a star-spangled melting pot seems quaint, of another
age.  Increasingly, America is a fractured landscape, its people
partitioned into dozens of cultural enclaves, its ideals reflected through
differing prisms of experience.  And this fracturing is likely to continue
as the self-concept of America shifts from a majority white-minority black
nation to a pluralistic society of many ethnic and racial groups.  At the
close of what's been called the American Century, during which the nation
emerged as the dominant world power in commerce and politics, old myths are
dying hard and new ones are just being forged.  In this clustered world,
the national identity is changing, and most of us don't even know it.
Forget the melting pot.  America today would be better characterized as a
salad bar.

Most human beings have to spend their lives in utter vulnerability.  All
are murderable and torturable, and survive only through the restraint shown
by more powerful neighbors.  All are born unequal, in terms of capacity or
strength.  All are born to the inherent frailty of the human condition,
naked and helpless, vulnerable all through life to the will of others,
limited by ignorance, limited by physical weakness, limited by fear,
limited by the phobias that fear engenders.
 
For nearly three thousand years now, the political and social genius of
what we can permissibly call 'Western man' has struggled with these brute
facts of our unsatisfactory existence.  Ever since the Hebrews discovered
personal moral responsibility and the Greeks discovered the autonomy of the
citizen, the effort has been made--with setbacks and defeats, with dark
ages and interregnums and any number of irrelevant adventures on the

It is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in
interpreting their state constitutions.  But it is equally important that
ambiguous or obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers
to a determination by this Court of the validity under the federal
constitution of state action. Intelligent exercise of our appellate powers
compels us to ask for the elimination of the obscurities and ambiguities
from the opinions in such cases.
 
Specifically, we are unclear as to the extent to which the Florida Supreme
Court saw the Florida Constitution as circumscribing the legislature's
authority under Art. II, Section 1, cl. 2. We are also unclear as to the
consideration the Florida Supreme Court accorded to 3 U. S. C. Section 5.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

legitimate election outcome?                    Note 1289

The definition of a legitimate election outcome is the same definition as
pornography -- you know it when you see it, or you know it when you feel
it.  The goal of the Supreme Court should be to encourage a solution -- a
statewide hand recount by a uniform standard -- that would leave both Mr.
Gore and Mr. Bush with a sick feeling that once the recount has started
they don't know who will win. When the court has re-established that sick
feeling in both men it will have ensured a legitimate outcome and restored
the authority of this election to where it belongs -- with "We the people."
It'll be a shame if it doesn't. After all, this is America.

Upon due consideration of the difficulties identified to this point, it is
obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the
requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial
additional work. It would require not only the adoption (after opportunity
for argument) of adequate statewide standards for determining what is a
legal vote, and practicable procedures to implement them, but also orderly
judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise. In addition, the
Secretary of State has advised that the recount of only a portion of the
ballots requires that the vote tabulation equipment be used to screen out
undervotes, a function for which the machines were not designed. If a
recount of overvotes were also required, perhaps even a second screening
would be necessary. Use of the equipment for this purpose, and any new
software developed for it, would have to be evaluated for accuracy by the
Secretary of State, as required by Fla. Stat. '101.015 (2000).
 
The Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the
State' s electors to "participat[e] fully in the federal electoral
process," as provided in 3 U. S. C. '5. ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op. at
27); see also Palm Beach Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, 2000 WL 1725434, *13
(Fla. 2000). That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or
contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive selection of electors be
completed by December 12. That date is upon us, and there is no recount
procedure in place under the State Supreme Court's order that comports with
minimal constitutional standards. Because it is evident that any recount
seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional for the
reasons we have discussed, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of

None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are
the members of this Court, and none stand more in admiration of the
Constitution's design to leave the selection of the President to the
people, through their legislatures, and to the political sphere. When
contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however, it becomes
our unsought responsibility to resolve the federal and constitutional
issues the judicial system has been forced to confront. The judgment of the
Supreme Court of Florida is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Pursuant to this Court's
Rule 45.2, the Clerk is directed to issue the mandate in this case
forthwith.
 
It is so ordered.

What must underlie petitioners' entire federal assault on the Florida
election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality
and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if
the vote count were to proceed.  Otherwise, their position is wholly
without merit.  The endorsement of that position by the majority of this
Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of
judges throughout the land.  It is confidence in the men and women who
administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of
law.  Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be
inflicted by today's decision.  One thing, however, is certain.  Although
we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of
this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly
clear.  It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian
of the rule of law.

The life of every individual, if we survey it as a whole and in general,
and only lay stress upon its most significant features, is really always a
tragedy, but gone through in detail, it has the character of a comedy.  For
the deeds and vexations of the day, the restless irritation of the moment,
the desires and fears of the week, the mishaps of every hour, are all
through chance, which is ever bent upon some jest, scenes of a comedy.
 
But the never-satisfied wishes, the frustrated efforts, the hopes
unmercifully crushed by fate, the unfortunate errors of the whole life,
with increasing suffering and death at the end, are always a tragedy.  
Thus, as if fate would add derision to the misery of our existence, our
life must contain all the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert
the dignity of tragic characters, but in the broad detail of life must
inevitably be the foolish characters of a comedy.

Baghdad Comes Under Air Attack, US Confirms Strike
 
By Hassan Hafidh
 
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Baghdad came under air attack on Friday and the U.S.
military confirmed it had launched an air strike on the Iraqi capital.
 
Baghdad has come under attack by American aggressors,'' an announcer said
on Iraqi television after sirens wailed in the Iraqi capital at 8:45 p.m.
 
Witnesses said they had clearly heard large explosions in Baghdad and Iraqi
anti-aircraft systems opened fire in the air.

The Landing Pilot is the Non-Handling Pilot until the "decision Altitude"
call, when the Handling Non-Landing Pilot hands the handling to the
Non-Handling Landing Pilot, unless the latter calls "go-around," in which
case the Handling Non-Landing Pilot continues handling and the Non-Handling
Landing Pilot continues non-handling until the next call of "land" or
"go-around" as appropriate.  In view of recent confusion over these rules,
it was deemed necessary to restate them clearly.

AUSTIN  A national textbook publisher has bowed to pressure from Republican
lawmakers and agreed to remove a picture and reference to Vice President Al
Gore in a fifth-grade reader that will be used in Texas schools.
 
The book, tentatively adopted by the State Board of Education on Thursday,
was revised by Harcourt School Publishers after two GOP legislators
objected to a brief article in the book in which Mr. Gore warned about the
dangers of the Internet to children.
 
Some State Board of Education members were prepared to criticize the Gore
picture and remarks in the book until Harcourt officials sent a letter
saying they would delete the references to the vice president.
 
Harcourt officials declined to comment Thursday.

People are saying that computers are dead, that the Internet is gone, and
the bubble's burst.  People are feeling really wounded because they bought
stocks at 100 times revenues, and they can't understand why their life's
savings is gone.  People, get a grip!  Look at what you did.  'Hey, that
truck hit me!'  Well, you play in the freeway, you are going to get hit by
a truck.

The last day in Champaign to reach a temperature of 60 or above was
November 5, 2000, 144 days ago.  That beat the old record for consecutive
days below 60, set in 1919, about 3 weeks ago, and no day in the forecast
is expected to break the streak.

Speaking only for myself, I think tobacco should be regulated.  We're
losing our mothers, our grandmothers, our sisters, and wives too soon,
directly because they are smoking.  It's affecting our families, our
businesses, our economy.  What starts out as a simple puff is turning into
a death sentence.

done.

Where The Mind is Without Fear
Rabindranath Tagore
 
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake
 
From Rabindranath Tagore's Geetanjali

My trusty bike has earned its rest
But not in the attic all covered with dust
Nor in the cellar to get all rust
 
But in my den on a pedestal tall
Or better still upon the wall
Where I can see it every day
And it will keep the blues away
 
We rode to win in every race
Fairly we played in every case
If life grows dull and things break bad
Just think of the wonderful days we've had.

who has left the world better than he found it, whether by an improved
poppy, a perfect poem or a rescued soul;

whose life was an inspiration; whose memory a benediction.

first time, it seems as though we did no more than recall it to our memory.

Indeed, anthropology is an excellent model for studying the process by
which software is built, for another reason: the most interesting part of
this process is the most human part of the process, the design and use of
the software itself.  Inasmuch as human oriented software engineering is
the study of this process, it could be argued that it is more properly a
branch of anthropology than of the mathematical sciences.  The study of
software creation may, in fact, be grossly misclassified in the academic
world today, leading to a distorted overemphasis on formal models and a
lack of basic work in collecting raw data that comes, most often, in
anecdotal (or at least non-quantitative) form. (p. 36)

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in

stove-lid.  She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that is
well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

Now, more than ever, the Internet must be wielded along with other media to
cast bright lights on all who would destroy freedom in the world.
Information is the torch of truth and its free flow is the bloodstream of
democracy.  The price of such free flow may be information we do NOT like
or believe, but the antidote to misinformation is more information, not
less.

... Then an experience that perhaps no good man can ever have in our world
came over him --- a torrent of perfectly unmixed and lawful hatred.  The
energy of hating, never before felt without some guilt, without some dim
knowledge that he was failing fully to distinguish the sinner from the sin,
rose into his arms and legs till he felt that they were pillars of burning
blood.  What was before him appeared no longer a creature of corrupted
will.  It was corruption itself to which will was attached only as an
instrument.  Ages ago it had been a Person:  but the ruins of personality
now survived in it only as weapons at the disposal of a furious self-exiled
negation.  It is perhaps difficult to understand why this filled Ransom not
with horror but with a kind of joy.  The joy came from finding at last what
hatred was made for.  As a boy with an axe rejoices at finding a tree, or a
boy with a box of coloured chalks rejoices on finding a pile of perfectly
white paper, so he rejoiced in the perfect congruity between his emotion
and its object.

Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when
the government's purposes are beneficial.  The greatest dangers to liberty
lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without
understanding.

Experience teaches us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the
government's purpose is beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert
to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest
dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well
meaning but without understanding.

There was no point in aiming at anything in this roiling chaos.  The tank

faceless heads and limbs like tree trunks.  These monstrosities fired their

New York City revises World Trade Center death toll below 4,000
Wednesday November 21, 11:07 PM, by Agence France-Presse
 
The official death toll in the September 11 terrorist attack on the World
Trade Center has been revised steadily downward, and now stands at below
4,000, city officials said.
 
A high of more than 6,500 in mid-September has steadily declined, apart
from minor spikes, as duplications have been discovered and people reported
as missing have been found.  The latest tally on Tuesday gave the total of
dead and missing as 3,948.
 
The New York Times on October 25 published an independent toll placing the
number of missing and dead at 2,950, some 1,800 less than the city's figure
at the time of 4,817.
 
Both The Associated Press and USA Today also have lists tabulating fewer

Throughout much of our lives, our association with the temporary has risen.
This transitory body, a sack of bones and flesh, is considered erroneously
as our true body and we have accepted this temporary condition as
conclusive.

The Beatles exist apart from my Self.  I am not really Beatle George.
Beatle George is like a suit or shirt that I once wore on occasion, and
until the end of my life people may see that shirt and mistake it for me.

"It is fundamental that the great powers of Congress to conduct
war and to regulate the Nation's foreign relations are subject to the
constitutional requirements of due process.  The imperative necessity
for safeguarding these rights to procedural due process under the
gravest of emergencies has existed throughout our constitutional
history, for it is then, under the pressing exigencies of crisis, that
there is the greatest temptation to dispense with fundamental

UBL: (...Inaudible...) we calculated in advance the number of casualties
from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We
calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors.
I was the most optimistic of them all. (...Inaudible...) due to my
experience in this field, I was thinking that the fire from the gas in the
plane would melt the iron structure of the building and collapse the area
where the plane hit and all the floors above it only. This is all that we
had hoped for.
